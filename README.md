 ### Project Overview
 ---
This Data Analysis Project aims to document my Progressive Learning Process on how to utilize Miscrosoft Excel, Power BI and SQL- Structured Querry Language, to transform  Raw Unstructured data to a Structured data suitable for Actionable and Insightful Decision Making.  This enables us to tell compelling stories around the data also.

### Data Sources
